                    <h1>Goodbye Remotes – Oomi “Smartest” Home is All You Need Now</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div id="blogtext">
                    <p>
                    In spite of being a part of an overcrowded smart home industry, I think there’s a lot we still need to improve on. Like using smartphone control which is quite complicated and not that easy as it sounds. Then again, we have tons of remotes for using our indoor accessories which makes our so called “smart living” turn into a mayhem within a few days. When you are referring to a smart home, don’t you think the only criteria we would want as a user is simplicity. We don’t look forward to having a process so complicated that the technophobes in our house are scared to use them. Imagine your parents who are not so versed with technology not being able to make use of smart home devices just because they are difficult to monitor and control. We need systems that are designed for all and not just for those who are tech-prone. It’s an age of minimal designs. It’s an age of simple controls. It’s an age of Oomi Smart Home!

                    <h1>Setup Done in Just 5 Minutes</h1>
                    Having smashed their funding goal on Indiegogo, this team from Chicago is about to make your smart home experience unlike what you’ve seen before. They believe that smart home does not need IoT. It’s a privilege all of us should experience and take our form of living to new heights altogether. As they like to call it, Oomi is not just another smart home system; it’s probably the “smartest” of all. The set includes a central hub called Oomi Cube and a controller called Oomi Touch.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog2.jpg" alt="oomi2">
                    This follows with a bunch of accessories which when combined with the system can make your smart home experience even better and simplified. Oomi can be set up in just 5 minutes with a simple tap and touch system that’s easy and hassle-free. So if you want to connect your devices with Oomi Cube, you just have to tap the controller on the device and touch on the screen to set it up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Oomi Touch is a Controller You’ll Love Using</h1>
                    As Slashgear commented, “No more of this ‘smartphone control makes everything super amazing’ nonsense.” Oomi Touch is a capacitive display with tactile buttons for quick control of your devices. The screen is entirely customizable so you can choose to control what’s most important to you. The tactile buttons will be truly helpful to change music tracks or surf through movies on Netflix or Youtube. From home entertainment to home security, this is a controller you can use to take charge of your home all the time.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog3.jpg" alt="oomi3">
                    <h1>Oomi Cube is the Smartest Brain of All</h1>
                    Now, if you have come across smart home systems before, you’ll know that there’s always a central hub. Oomi Cube does the same for the Oomi Smart Home system but in a more useful way. It isn’t just a simple hub doing nothing extraordinary. Instead, it’s a hub that has been equipped with tons of sensors that will help you control your home in a more compact and simplified way.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog4.jpg" alt="oomi4">

                    <h1>Smart Home That Isn’t IoT</h1>
                    Since Oomi uses the next generation of Z-Wave technology, you can connect it easily with existing smart home gadgets and take control of them from one single remote. But the team has also come up with additional accessories you can pair up with the system.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog6.jpg" alt="oomi6">
                    These include the Oomi Bulb, Oomi Plug, Oomi Multisensor, Oomi Door and Window Sensor and two additionals as Oomi Streamer (for streaming HD media directly from the internet to your television) and Oomi Air (for monitoring air contaminants to make sure your air is healthy). Now you can pretty well imagine how cool it will be like living with this entire system which doesn’t use Internet and can even work when your network is down.
                    <br>
                    With Oomi, you’ll get notified whenever something goes wrong or is out of place. But in case you want to have enhanced security, try using the Oomi Personal Home Monitoring (PHM). It’s like this team has thought of every single thing you might expect out of a smart home and packed it all up into a compact system anyone and everyone can use. With the basic kit starting at $299, you can pre-order your set now and take that step ahead towards living a dream. Let’s be a part of the Oomi “COMOOMITY”! Happy Gadgeting!

                    <h1>Sensoria Gets You To Hit The Ground Running</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div id="blogtext">
                    <p>
                    Staying in shape is always at the top of our to-do lists. Many of us stick to running; we can do it anywhere and it requires little equipment. But, however easy running seems to be; most of us are doing it wrong. Sensoria smart socks are designed to make you run smarter, not harder.
                    <br>
                   Equipped with sensors throughout the cloth, Sensoria socks can determine if your running habits are actually detrimental to your health. In turn, the Sensoria app guides you in real-time on how to improve so you can start to see, and feel, results.
                    <br>
                    Sensoria works with three tools: the smart socks, an electronic anklet, and an accompanying app. There are textile pressure sensors on the socks located in the plantar area, the heel, and two in the metatarsal area (ball of the foot). The placement of the sensors allows the anklet to record where you’re putting pressure, which part of the foot hits the ground first, and how hard you’re running.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog11.jpg" alt="sensoria1">
                    The anklet, which comes in white, snaps neatly around your ankle. The designers recommend rolling the cuff of the smart sock over the top to ensure it works properly. There are five strong magnetic strips to keep the anklet in place. It takes an hour and a half to charge but it will last you 6 hours if used continuously (or a month if you don’t use it at all). It’s splash resistant and just 28 grams which makes it perfect for all of your runs.
                   <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog7.jpg" alt="sensoria2">
                    The socks are made of a comfortable wicking sports fabric to fit snugly yet dry quickly. They come in a neutral grey so they’ll go with any work out clothes you own and can be washed with them, too (but stick to air drying). There are four sizes available ranging from Men’s 5 to 15 and Women’s 2 to 13.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog8.jpg" alt="sensoria3">
                    The app ingeniously monitors your running style, tracks your metrics, allows you to set goals, and will even speak to you during your run. The messages could be real-time tips on how to improve your cadence, speed, pace, and foot landing or just encouragement to get off your bum and work out. For your cadence, you could listen to a metronome if you’re musically inclined or choose the voice feedback. There is video assistance if you need a hand in mastering the craft.
                   <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog9.jpg" alt="sensoria4">
                    Sensoria’s app goes a step further by allowing you to even find the perfect running shoes by comparing over 7000 options in their virtual closet. Not only will you be able to see which shoe will work best with your running style, you can get reminders to upgrade your shoes as well.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog10.jpg" alt="sensoria5">
                    The Sensoria Fitness Bundle (two pairs of socks, the anklet, a charger, and the app) is available for $199 and will ship in about a month. In their online store you can also find extra socks, heart rate monitors, and other smart clothing to get your exercise in the best shape possible.

                    <h1>Take Your Drone Game To The Next Level With DJI Phantom 3</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div id="blogtext">
                    <p>
                    Each new release of the DJI Phantom Drone series gets better and better. This year, the company released its latest addition called DJI Phantom 3. Is the new model right for you? Read on to find out.
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog12.jpg" alt="drone1">
                    <h1>Enhanced GPS</h1>
                    The DJI Phantom 3 packs some serious upgrades compared to the previous model. First, users can benefit from accurate GPS guidance using GLONASS technology. This lets the quadcopter communicate with satellites efficiently, greatly minimizing the chances of a crash. There is also a new visual positioning system that stablizes the drone without the help of GPS. The new feature is perfect for indoor shooting, such as warehouses or large events.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Instant Power and Control</h1>
                    Flying a drone takes practice. For novice users, the DJI Phantom 3 includes instant fly and land capabilities to ease the learning curve of flying. The convienient features are also ideal for emergency situations.

                    <h1>Live HD Streaming</h1>
                    With a radius of two kilometers, individuals can stream a live feed to YouTube. The technology is called Lightbridge and was specifically designed for breathtaking aerial views- think hot air ballons, volcanoes and overhead city traffic shots.
                    <br>
                    <i>“Pilots, whether they are journalists, extreme athletes, or global travellers – will not just be able to share aerial videos of where they were, but will also be able to send a YouTube link to their friends and colleagues to show them the aerial perspectives of where they are right now,” said DJI’s San Francisco General Manager Eric Cheng.</i>
                    <img  class="img-responsive" align="left"  width="100%" src="images/blog/blog14.jpg" alt="drone3">
                    <h1>Two Versions</h1>
                    The DJI Phantom 3 will come in two different versions: the advanced edition and the professional edition. The advanced model comes with a 1080p camera and will be priced at $999. On the other hand, the professional edition boasts a 4k video camera with a $1,259 price tag. It also incorporates faster battery charging features.
